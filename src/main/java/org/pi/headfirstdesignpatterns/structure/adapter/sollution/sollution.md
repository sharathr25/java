* We can solve the problem using **Adapter Pattern**
* The **Adapter Pattern** converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
* We created an adapter i.e, `ACPowerAdapter` which takes one interface i.e, `StandardACPlug` and converts it another interface i.e, EuropeanACPlug so that we can connect to client i.e, `EuropeanWallSocket`
