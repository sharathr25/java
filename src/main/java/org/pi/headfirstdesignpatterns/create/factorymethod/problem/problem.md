So you test marketed the SimpleFactory idea, and what you found was that the franchises were using your factory to create pizzas, but starting to employ their own home grown procedures for the rest of the process: they’d bake things a little differently, they’d forget to cut the pizza and they’d use third-party boxes.

* NyPizzaStore is not cutting the pizza. `pizza.cut();` not called
* ChicagoPizzaStore is not using franchise pizza box. `pizza.box();` not called
